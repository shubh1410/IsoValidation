# IsoValidation

This is part of MOSIP project. 
Given Biometric data in CBEFF format this validates if the data complies to the ISO standards ISO/IEC 19794-4, -5, and -6 for fingerprint, iris, face respectively. Presently, it is implemented for Iris only, but we can easily extend it for other biometric data.
